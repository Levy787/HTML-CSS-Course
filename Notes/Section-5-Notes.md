SECTION 5 - Web Design

Web design is the overall look and feel of a website, web developers then implement the web design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Web Design is generally done using sketch, figma, Adobe CD or Adobe Photoshop. The web developer then looks at these designs and implements it. The product is then shipped for the user.

Even if we are not web designers or artists, we can still design nice interfaces by using a framework/system, that is what this section will teach.

The essential things we must get right are
    1. Topography
    2. Colors
    3. Images/illustrations
    4. Icons
    5. Shadows
    6. Border-radius
    7. Whitespace
    8. User Experience
    9. Componenets/Layout


By altering the above ingrediernts, we can give a website a certain personality e.g.,
    1. Serious/Elegant
        - Convey luxury and eleghance, thin serig typeface, golden and pastel colors, big high quality images
    2. Minimalist/Simple
        - Focus is placed on the essential text content and images. Uses small to medium sans-serif black text, lines, and few images/icons.
    3. Plain/Neutral
        - Generally used by large corporations, uses small typefaces, very structured layout.
    4. Bold/Confident
        - Makes an impact, big and bold typography paired with confident use of big and bright colored blocks.
    5. Calm/Peaceful
        - Products which make the use thinks they are cared for by the website. Generally has calming pastel colors, soft serif heading, matching images/illustrations.
    6. Startup/Upbeat
        - Used among startup companies, gas medium sans-serif typefaces, light grey text and backgrounds, rounded elements.
    7. Playful/Fun
        -Colourful and round designs, a lot of creative elemnts such as hand-drawn icons and illustrations, animations and fun languages.

Diffent websites need different designs based on their content, this is up to the web designer to come up with.

TYPOGRAPHY

Topography is the arranging and style of text to make language legible, readable and appealing when displayed. Or make text beautiful and easy to read.

Serif vs Sans-serif

Serif font has details on the edge of the text, called serifs. It is traditional text with a classic look and feel, it conveys trustworthiness.

Sans-serif does not have the details on the edges of text, this creates a clean, simple and modern look. Sans-serif is much easier to work with as beginner designers.

Rules

Only use good and popular typefaces, some exapmples include.

Sans-serif
    - Inter
    - Open Sans
    - Roboto
    - Montserrat
    - Work Sans
    - Lato

Serif
    - Merriweather
    - Aleo
    - Playfair Display
    - Cormorant
    - Cardo
    - Lora

As beginners, we should aim to use only one typeface, if we would like to experiment, we can try using two.

We choose the font based on what website personality we are going for.

1. Determine personality
2. Determin Serif or Sans-serif based on personality
3. Choose from front above based on Serif or Sans-serif

FONT SIZES

To make our lives easier, limit sizing choices, we should use a type scale tool with pre defined ranges.

For normal paragraph text, we should use between 16px and 32px.

For long text format, we should use 20px or larger.

For large headlines we should use 50px or larger and use bold (weight of 600+) depending on personality.

We should never use a weight of less than 400.

READING EXPERIENCE

Try use less than 75 character per line.

Try and use a line height of 1.5 - 2 for normal text and less than 1.5 for headlines. The smaller the text, the larger the line height.

If headlines look unnatural, try decrease the letter spacing.

Use all caps for short titles.

Never justify text on the web.

Avoid centering text, it makes it more difficult to read.

We often can't follow all rules when designing a website but we should follow the guidelines as best we can.

We can use this website to help us come up with a font sizing system.

COLORS

Colors are a complex topic, we must choose colors to match the personality of the website

Different colors and their meanings
    - red
        - Draws the most attention, power, passion and excitement
    -orange
        - Less agressive, happiness, cheerfulness and creativity
    -Yellow
        - Joy, brightness and intellignece
    -Green
        - Harmony, naturem growth and health
    - Blue
        - Peace, trustworthiness, professionalism
    - Purple
        - Wealth, wisdom, magic
    -Pink
        - Romance, care, affection
    - Brown
        - Nature, durability, comfort
    -Black
        - Power, elegance, minimalism, greif, sorrow
        - Difficult to use as beginners

Once we have chosen a color we should select a good color tone, there are three common mnethods of choosing good colors

1. Open Color
2. Tailwindcss
3. Flat UI colors 2

In any web design we need our main color and a grey color. We generally have content boxes with a fill of the main color and text with the grey color.

Once we get a bit more experienced, we can also add an accent color, there should be a relationship between the main and accent color, we can use one of the above tools to assist us here.

Once we have our main, accent and grey colors we should then have lighter and darker shades of each one (tints and shades), again this is done with Open Color. If we select out own custom color, we could also use a tint and shade generator.

We can also use palleton or coolers to help us select our color pallet.

---
WHEN AND HOW TO USE COLORS

Buttons, Logo - Main color

Standout components, icon color, highlighted text, underlined text, borders, different colored text - Accent color

Dark coloured backgrounds - Try use a tint of the same background color.

Text should never be completely black.

Dont make text too light. We can use the coolers tool to give us a contrast ratio, for normal text it should be atleast 4.5:1 for large text it should be 3:1 (18px +).

We can also select images to use which have out main color embedded in them.

--- IMAGES ---

There are essentially four types of images:
1. Product photos
    - Show the product we are selling.
2. Storytelling photos
    - Used to sell the product, may show the product being used (MOST IMPORTANT).
3. Illustrations
    - A more abstract way to story telling and helps bring out personality.
4. Patterns
    - May appear as a background or behind components to make components a bit less boring (don't use too many).

Images should be used, try keep them relevant to the website and the particular section they related to.

We should try and use original images, otherwise we can use stock images. Try keep our images looking real.

Some good stock image resources are

    - Unsplash
    - pexels
    - Drawkit
    - unDraw

---

USING IMAGES WELL

Try to use images of real people.

Crop images to make them fit.

Combine photos, illustrations and patterns to get interesting effects.

If we have text over an image, darken the part of the image which has the text. We can acheive this using a gradient filter over the image.

Place text in the neutral area of the image, e.g., if there is an area with a sky, place the text there etc. We just need to keep in mind what may happen when we are looking at the page on a smaller screen.

Place the text in a box which has some opacity.

---

Techincal details

We need to account for high res screens, make image dimentions 2x as big as their displayed size. e.g., if we would like to display a 300 x 300px, the actual image size should be 600 x 600px, this is called scale factor, on the latest iphones, this can be up to 3x.

Compress images for a lower file size and better performance, we can use one of the below tools for this:

    - Unsplash
    - Pexels
    - DrawKit
    - unDraw
    - Squoosh

When using images side by side, we should ensure they all have the exact same dimentions.

-- ICONS --

The key to using icons is to use a good icon pack, the below are some good resources:
    - Phosphor icons
    - ionicons
    - ICONS8
    - heroicons

We could also consider using emojis.

Only ever use one icon pack, never mix and match icon packs.

Only use icons in the SVG format or icon fonts.

We choose the icon pack based on the website personality and topography, look for roundness, weight, filled/outlined.

Some personalities may never actually need icons.

--- 
USING ICONS

The main use of icons is to provide visual assistance to text.

We can also use them to build feature blocks, they help describe features of a certain product.

They may also be used for actions such as buttons. Again providing a visual assistance.

We can also use icons as bullet points.

For normal icons, use the same color as out text, if we would like to draw more attention, we can use a different color.

Don't confuse the user by using random icons, make sure the icons are relevant to the text.

Do not make icons larger than they need to be, also ensure the lines are not too thick. We may also want to wrap an icon in a seperate container such as a circle.

To actually use icons, we are best off copying the SVG code and pasting it into our project.
