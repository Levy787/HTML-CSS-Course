--- RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN ---

A technique to make the webpage adjust to different screen sizes. The four ingredients to responsive web design are

1. Fluid layouts
    - Allows the webpage to adapt to the current viewport.
    - Use %, vh or vw
    - max width instead of width
2. Responsive Units
    - Use rem units rather than pixels
    - Make it easy to scale the entire layout
    - Set 1rem to 10px
3. Flexible images
    - Images do not scale automatically as we change the viewport
    - Use % and the max width property
4. Media queries
    - Change CSS styles depending on viewport width, this is generally done at the end.


The easiest way to make a responsive website is to design first for desktop then move to smaller mobile devices.
As mobiles have become a lot bigger, people are benginning to create the mobile view first then the desktop view.
