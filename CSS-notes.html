    <h1>CSS Notes</h1>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      We use CSS to style the HTML CSS consists of properties which we then
      change to alter the style
    </p>
    <p>v Selector</p>
    <p>
      h1 { <br />
      &emsp;color: blue; <- Declertation/style <br />
      &emsp;text-align: center; <br />
      &emsp;font-size: 20px; <br />}
    </p>
    <p>v Property</p>
    <p>font-size: 20px; <- value</p>
    <p><br />We can insert CSS comments with */ comment here /*.</p>
    <h2>Common ways of writing CSS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In-line CSS</li>
      <li>Internal CSS</li>
      <li>external CSS</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>In-line CSS</h3>
    <p>
      To style html inline, we simply use the style attribute on any of our html
      tags e.g., <br />&lt;h1 style="color:blue"&gt;heading is now
      blue&lt;/h1&gt;
    </p>
    <p>In line styles should <strong>never</strong> be used!<strong</p>
    <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>
      To use internal styling, we add a style tag within the head tag e.g.,<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&emsp;&lt;style&gt<br />&emsp;&emsp;color:
      blue;<br />&emsp;&lt;/style&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      This will then apply a blue color to all h1 tags within our html. This
      approach seperates our concernes a bit and is a reccommened approach over
      In-line CSS but still not the best.
    </p>
    <h2>External CSS</h2>
    <p>
      The preffered approach is to create an external style sheet. We do this by
      creating a new file called say style.css.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have created our stylesheet, we then need to link the css file to
      our html doc, we do this in the head tag. We do this with a link tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;head&gt;<br />&emsp;&lt;link href="./style.css" rel="stylesheet"
      /&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;
    </p>
    <p>Now this style sheet will be applied to our html document.</p>
    <h2>CSS properties</h2>
    <p>
      We always have a selector which determines where to apply the style e.g.,
      if we have h1 {...} this will select all h1 tags and apply this styling to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>Some other properties we can apply are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>font-size: 26px; &larr;Sets the font size to 26px</li>
      <li>font-family: sans-serif; &larr;Sets the font family</li>
      <li>
        text-transform: uppercase; &larr;Allows us to transform the text in
        certain ways such as uppercase.
      </li>
      <li>
        font-style: italic; &larr;Sets the font to italic, we could also say
        bold etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is also a line height property which specifies the line height in
      relation to the size of the text, 1 = same size as text, 1.5 = 150% of
      text height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong, em and a tags all inherit from a p tag which means that when
      we apply styling to a p tag, it will automatically be applied to the given
      tags, it will not override the html functionality however, e.g., a strong
      tag will always remain strong regardless of CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another CSS property is the text align which aligns the text on the
      vertical axis, e.g., left, center right. We would say<br />&emsp;text-align:
      centre;
    </p>
    <h3>Combining selectors</h3>
    <p>
      We have just applied font-family to the h1, h2, h3, h4, p and li tags. We
      can do this in a much better way, we do this by selecting many elements at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>h1, h2, h3, h4, p, li {<br />&emsp;font-family: sans-serif;<br />}</p>
    <p>This is called a list selector and selects all instances of the list.</p>
    <h4>Descendent selector</h4>
    <p>
      We can sytle an element which is within another element e.g.,<br />&lt;footer&gt;<br />&emsp;&lt;p&gt;This
      will be styled&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/footer&gt;
    </p>
    <p>The above will be styled below.</p>
    <p>footer p {<br />&emsp;font-size: 16px;<br />}</p>
    <p>
      So all p tags who are children of footer tags will be styled accordingly.
      This is not overly robust as its dependent on the html structure. This is
      not scalable.
    </p>
    <h4>Using Classes and ID for styling</h4>
    <p>
      We can set the id attribute to html tags then set styles based on that.
      e.g.,
    </p>
    <p>&lt;p id="author"&gt;James Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>We then select id's in CSS by using the # symbol e.g.,</p>
    <p>#author {<br />&emsp;font-style: italic;<br />}</p>
    <p>The '#' select id's, the '.' selects classes.</p>
    <h4>Classes vs Id's</h4>
    <p>
      The main difference between a class and an Id is that we cannot repeat an
      id, e.g., if we have an id of 'copywrite', we can only have one of those,
      if that were say a class, we could have many of them.
    </p>
    <p>Setting class can be done like below.</p>
    <p>
      .related-author {<br />&emsp;font-size: 18px;<br />&emsp;font-weight:
      bold;<br />}
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally in the real world, we never use id's, we only use classes as
      this allows us to scale the page easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something to note is that currently, some of out p tags are being selected
      up to three times. We will revisit this later.
    </p>
    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <p>
      In CSS there are a ref diferent ways we can represent colors, the two main
      methods are rgb or hex.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use rgb notation we use say rgb(0, 255, 255), we can also use reba
      which allows us to specify the transperency of color, 0 fully transparent,
      1 fully opaque. rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)
    </p>
    <p>
      to use hex colors we just specify #xxxxxx, rgb in hexidecimal #00ffff this
      is the same as rgb(0, 255, 255).
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have all the numbers exactly the same we get a black, white or
      gray color.
    </p>
    <p>We specify the color of an element using the color property. e.g.,</p>
    <p>h1 {<br />&emsp;color: #1098AD;<br />}</p>
    <h2>Borders</h2>
    <p>
      Borders are another property which we can style with CSS, it is called a
      short hand property as we can define many things at once. Generally it
      goes border: &lt;width&gt; &lt;line fill&gt; &lt;color&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      So border: 5px, solid, #1098AD; Would create a 5px solid border of color
      #1098AD. Other styles we can use are dotted, dashed etc.,
    </p>
    <p>
      There are special variants such as border-top or border-bottom which will
      just style the top or bottom.
