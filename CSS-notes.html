    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      We use CSS to style the HTML CSS consists of properties which we then
      change to alter the style

    <h2>Common ways of writing CSS</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In-line CSS</li>
      <li>Internal CSS</li>
      <li>external CSS</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>In-line CSS</h3>
    <p>
      To style html inline, we simply use the style attribute on any of our html
      tags e.g., <br />&lt;h1 style="color:blue"&gt;heading is now
      blue&lt;/h1&gt;
    </p>
    <p>In line styles should <strong>never</strong> be used!<strong</p>
    <h2>Internal CSS</h2>
    <p>
      To use internal styling, we add a style tag within the head tag e.g.,<br />&lt;head&gt;<br />&emsp;&lt;style&gt<br />&emsp;&emsp;color:
      blue;<br />&emsp;&lt;/style&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      This will then apply a blue color to all h1 tags within our html. This
      approach seperates our concernes a bit and is a reccommened approach over
      In-line CSS but still not the best.
    </p>
    <h2>External CSS</h2>
    <p>
      The preffered approach is to create an external style sheet. We do this by
      creating a new file called say style.css.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we have created our stylesheet, we then need to link the css file to
      our html doc, we do this in the head tag. We do this with a link tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;head&gt;<br />&emsp;&lt;link href="./style.css" rel="stylesheet"
      /&gt;<br />&lt;/head&gt;
    </p>
    <p>Now this style sheet will be applied to our html document.</p>
    <h2>CSS properties</h2>
    <p>
      We always have a selector which determines where to apply the style e.g.,
      if we have h1 {...} this will select all h1 tags and apply this styling to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>Some other properties we can apply are</p>
    <ul>
      <li>font-size: 26px; &larr;Sets the font size to 26px</li>
      <li>font-family: sans-serif; &larr;Sets the font family</li>
      <li>
        text-transform: uppercase; &larr;Allows us to transform the text in
        certain ways such as uppercase.
      </li>
      <li>
        font-style: italic; &larr;Sets the font to italic, we could also say
        bold etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There is also a line height property which specifies the line height in
      relation to the size of the text, 1 = same size as text, 1.5 = 150% of
      text height.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strong, em and a tags all inherit from a p tag which means that when
      we apply styling to a p tag, it will automatically be applied to the given
      tags, it will not override the html functionality however, e.g., a strong
      tag will always remain strong regardless of CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another CSS property is the text align which aligns the text on the
      vertical axis, e.g., left, center right. We would say<br />&emsp;text-align:
      centre;
    </p>
    <h3>Combining selectors</h3>
    <p>
      We have just applied font-family to the h1, h2, h3, h4, p and li tags. We
      can do this in a much better way, we do this by selecting many elements at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>h1, h2, h3, h4, p, li {<br />&emsp;font-family: sans-serif;<br />}</p>
    <p>This is called a list selector and selects all instances of the list.</p>
    <h4>Descendent selector</h4>
    <p>
      We can sytle an element which is within another element e.g.,<br />&lt;footer&gt;<br />&emsp;&lt;p&gt;This
      will be styled&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;/footer&gt;
    </p>
    <p>The above will be styled below.</p>
    <p>footer p {<br />&emsp;font-size: 16px;<br />}</p>
    <p>
      So all p tags who are children of footer tags will be styled accordingly.
      This is not overly robust as its dependent on the html structure. This is
      not scalable.
    </p>
    <h4>Using Classes and ID for styling</h4>
    <p>
      We can set the id attribute to html tags then set styles based on that.
      e.g.,
    </p>
    <p>&lt;p id="author"&gt;James Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p>We then select id's in CSS by using the # symbol e.g.,</p>
    <p>#author {<br />&emsp;font-style: italic;<br />}</p>
    <p>The '#' select id's, the '.' selects classes.</p>
    <h4>Classes vs Id's</h4>
    <p>
      The main difference between a class and an Id is that we cannot repeat an
      id, e.g., if we have an id of 'copywrite', we can only have one of those,
      if that were say a class, we could have many of them.
    </p>
    <p>Setting class can be done like below.</p>
    <p>
      .related-author {<br />&emsp;font-size: 18px;<br />&emsp;font-weight:
      bold;<br />}
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally in the real world, we never use id's, we only use classes as
      this allows us to scale the page easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something to note is that currently, some of out p tags are being selected
      up to three times. We will revisit this later.
    </p>
    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <p>
      In CSS there are a ref diferent ways we can represent colors, the two main
      methods are rgb or hex.
    </p>
    <p>
      To use rgb notation we use say rgb(0, 255, 255), we can also use reba
      which allows us to specify the transperency of color, 0 fully transparent,
      1 fully opaque. rgba(0, 255, 255, 0.3)
    </p>
    <p>
      to use hex colors we just specify #xxxxxx, rgb in hexidecimal #00ffff this
      is the same as rgb(0, 255, 255).
    </p>
    <p>
      When we have all the numbers exactly the same we get a black, white or
      gray color.
    </p>
    <p>We specify the color of an element using the color property. e.g.,</p>
    <p>h1 {<br />&emsp;color: #1098AD;<br />}</p>
    <h2>Borders</h2>
    <p>
      Borders are another property which we can style with CSS, it is called a
      short hand property as we can define many things at once. Generally it
      goes border: &lt;width&gt; &lt;line fill&gt; &lt;color&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
      So border: 5px, solid, #1098AD; Would create a 5px solid border of color
      #1098AD. Other styles we can use are dotted, dashed etc.,
    </p>
    <p>
      There are special variants such as border-top or border-bottom which will
      just style the top or bottom.
    </p>
    <h2>Pseudo Code</h2>
    <p>
      If we wanted to select the first element of a list to make it bold, the
      way we would go about it now is to hand the first element a class of say
      'first-element', we would then write some CSS to select that class and
      make it bold. A much better way of doing this is to use CSS pseudo
      classes. This means we can select an element then put a colon and select
      other things specific things in relation to that. For example we could
      choose li:first-child which will get the first child from a list and style
      it. To make the first child bold we would say
    </p>
    <p>li:first-child{<br />&emsp;font-weight: bold;<br />}</p>

    <p>
      <br />Some other examples are li:last-child{...}, li:nth-child(2){...} <-
      This one selects the second list element and styles it.
      <br />li:nth-child(odd) {...} <- styles every odd element. This one can be
      very good for styling tables which have alternating colors.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />Based on what we have just learned, we would expect that we can now
      select the first p tag within our article using a pseudo class as follows
      <br />&emsp;article p:first-child{...}
    </p>
    <p>
      However we will find this will not work, as first child will try to select
      the first child in the article tag, which in our case is the header tag.
      This would work if we had a paragraph as the first child under our article
      tag. Hencem pseudo classes dont work well for random classes within
      classes, but it works really well for things like lists and tables, this
      is because all children are often the same.
    </p>
    <h3>Styling anchors</h3>
    <p>
      We may try to style an anchor using a {...}, this is bad practce though as
      we can no longer style it based on it's state. A better practice is to us
      anchor pseudo classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we may style them like below<br />a:link {<br />&emsp;color: #1095ad<br />}<br />This
      will ensure only a tags with links will by styled as opposed to all a tags
      regardless of whether it has a href or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have a visited pseudo class for visited links, we generally set
      this the same as the normal unvisited link and group them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very useful pesudo class is the a:hover{...}, this will change the
      styling of the html whenever we hover over the link.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have a:active which is the styling for when we are clicking on the
      a tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      We should always add anchor styling in this order, link, visited, hover,
      active.
    </p>
    <h2>Conflicting selectors</h2>
    <p>Imagine we have the below.</p>
    <p>
      .author {<br />&emsp;font-style: italic;<br />&emsp;font-size: 18px;<br />}<br /><br />#author-text
      {<br />&emsp;font-size: 20px;<br />}<br /><br />p, li {<br />&emsp;font-family:
      sans-serif;<br />&emsp;color: #444;<br />&emsp;font-size:22px<br />}<br /><br /><br />&lt;
      p id="author-text" class="author"&gt;<br />&emsp;Posted by Laura Jones on
      Monsay, June 21st 2027<br />&lt;/p&gt;<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The html is being selected three times by CSS, which styling does it use?
      The answer is all of them.
    </p>
    <p>The main issue is that there is conflicting font size decorations.</p>
    <p>
      CSS has a list of priorities, the basic list is ID, class or pseudo class,
      general tags. So if we have a font size set for the tag of 19px and a font
      size set for the ID of 25px, the font will be 25px as the ID selector has
      higher priority than the tag selector.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we have say two conflicting id selectors, its the last style in the
      document which will be used.
    </p>
    <p>There is also a universal selector '*' but more on this later.</p>

    <p>
      So in the above example, the CSS applied would be
      <br />{<br />&emsp;font-size: 20px;<br />&emsp;font-style: italic;<br />&emsp;font-family:
      sans-serif;<br />&emsp;color: #444l<br />}
    </p>
    <p>
      In line styles have a higher priority than ID selectors and important
      styles (marked with a '!') have priority over all others.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Important styles (!)</li>
      <li>Inline styles</li>
      <li>ID selector (#)</li>
      <li>Class Selector (.)</li>
      <li>Element selector</li>
      <li>Universal selector (*)</li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <p>
      We can make a CSS style important as below.<br /><br />footer p {<br />&emsp;color:
      green !important;<br />}
    </p>
    <h2>Inheritance and the universal selector</h2>
    <p>
      Inheritance comes from parent and children, for example we have a body tag
      as the parent then eveything inside that body tag is a child tag and
      inherits styles from it. For example, if we set the body tag to have a
      color of red, all tags within that body tag will be given a color of red,
      this is easily overridden however. It's almost like a base style for our
      page to fall back on.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a lot of styles which dont get passed down, one of these include
      the border, for example, if we set the body tag with a border-top: 10px
      solid #1095ad, that style will only be applied to the body tag and will
      not be passed down.
    </p>
    <p>The properties which do get inherited are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>font-family</li>
      <li>font-size</li>
      <li>font-weight</li>
      <li>font-style</li>
      <li>color</li>
      <li>line-height</li>
      <li>letter-spacing</li>
      <li>text-align</li>
      <li>text-transformation</li>
      <li>text-shadow</li>
      <li>line-style</li>
      <li>Others</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If we would like everything to get selected, we could use the universal
      selector e.g., * {...}, we could then give it a property of say
      border-top: 10px solid white and it will give every element in out html a
      top border.
    </p>
    <h2>The Box Model</h2>
    <p>
      The box model is used in CSS and basically everything that is on a webpage
      is in a box with a given width and height. Around that content we have
      padding, then a border then margin. We can add any of these to a tag by
      specifying say padding-top, margin-bottom etc. A short hand way to add
      them is to just say padding: 10px 20px; the first number will be applied
      to the top and bottom, the second number will be applied to either side.
    </p>
    <h3>Collaping margins</h3>
    <p>Say we have the below...</p>
    <p>
      &lt;p class="e1"&gt;Element 1&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p class="e2"&gt;Element
      2&lt;/p&gt;<br /><br />.e1 {<br />&emsp;margin-bottom: 50px;&emsp;}<br /><br />.e2
      {<br />&emsp;margin-top: 60px;<br />}
    </p>
    <p>
      We may assume that we would add both margins together and get a 110px gap
      between the two elements. This is not the case, if we have two margins
      which are next to each other, CSS will select the larger of the two and
      just use that as spacing between the two items.
    </p>
    <h2>Dimentions</h2>
    <p>
      We can easily set the dimentions of elements usign the width and height
      properties. We never want to do this in HTML but rather in CSS. When we
      set one the other will be automatically assigned to keep the aspect
      ration. We can force a certain aspect ratio by setting both height and
      width.
    </p>
    <p>
      We dont always have to use px to set the width and height, we can also use
      %, if we say 100% the element will take up the entire content area of the
      parent. So if we had an image and set the width to 100% it would stretch
      across the enitre width of the page keeping a consistent aspect ration.
      This allows us to begin creating a responsive web page.
    </p>
    <h2>Alignment and Centre</h2>
    <p>
      It is currently quite difficult to centre all the content on the page but
      there is a simple trick we can use to do so. First we wrap out entire
      content in a div tag, this is simply a tag which groups things together
      but has not semantic meaning. We then apply a class called content. We
      then style this content to have a width of say 700px and then have margin
      left and right to be automatic. This will keep all the content of the page
      at a max width of 700px then apply an automatic margin either side of the
      contet to keep the 700px contianer centred.
    </p>
